# Dynamic-Delivery
The WGUPS Package Routing Program optimizes deliveries using the on_the_way algorithm, which considers deadlines, truck capacity, and travel distances to minimize mileage. Unlike a simple greedy approach, it dynamically adjusts routes with priority-based heuristics, reducing backtracking and ensuring timely deliveries.
