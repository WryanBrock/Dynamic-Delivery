# WGUPS Package Routing Program ðŸššðŸ“¦  

## Overview  
The **WGUPS Package Routing Program** is a logistics optimization system designed to efficiently manage and deliver packages for the **Western Governors University Postal Service (WGUPS)**. The program processes delivery constraints such as **package deadlines, truck capacity, and travel distances** by implementing a custom **route optimization algorithm** called **on_the_way**.  

Using data from **CSV files**, the system loads package details into a **chaining hash table** for fast lookups and dynamically assigns them to delivery trucks. It then calculates the most efficient **delivery sequence**, ensuring that **priority packages reach their destinations on time** while minimizing overall mileage.  

The system is structured around core components:  
- **Truck Class** â€“ Manages vehicle routes and deliveries.  
- **Package Class** â€“ Tracks shipment details and delivery status.  
- **Controller Module** â€“ Orchestrates the overall delivery process.  

This project simulates **real-world package distribution challenges** and demonstrates how **algorithmic efficiency enhances last-mile delivery logistics**.  

## Algorithm: on_the_way ðŸš€  
At the heart of this system is the **on_the_way algorithm**, a custom **route optimization method** that extends the traditional **greedy nearest-neighbor approach**. Unlike a purely greedy algorithm that **selects the nearest available delivery stop**, **on_the_way** incorporates additional **heuristics** such as:  
- **Delivery time constraints** â€“ Ensures urgent packages arrive on time.  
- **Package dependencies** â€“ Accounts for items that must be delivered together.  
- **Truck availability** â€“ Optimizes routes based on vehicle capacity and assignments.  

The algorithm **dynamically adjusts delivery sequences** to **prevent backtracking**, **reduce total travel distance**, and **prioritize high-importance deliveries**. It likely employs a **hybrid nearest-neighbor approach with limited lookahead**, evaluating multiple routes before committing to a delivery order.  

This refined approach allows for **greater efficiency than standard greedy methods**, making it ideal for **real-world logistics scenarios**, particularly those involving **time-sensitive packages and multi-truck coordination**.
